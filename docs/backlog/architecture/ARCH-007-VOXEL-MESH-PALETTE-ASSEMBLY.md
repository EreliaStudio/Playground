# ARCH-007 — Voxel Meshing, Palette Binding, and Assembly Contract

## Fixed pipeline

```text
VoxelVolume + MaterialResolver
              ↓
 VoxelMesher (cached occlusion + default empty boundary)
              ↑
 Chunk::Mesher (external-neighbor override only)
                         ↓
                     VoxelMesh
                         ↓
             voxel rendering + bound Palette
```

- `VoxelVolume` owns one runtime-sized vector of cells, generic versioning, and a batched RAII editor. It exposes dimensions, uniform voxel scale, bounds, checked coordinate access, and a read-only span. One changed edit session publishes one invalidation; it owns no world lookup, palette, animation, or rendering behavior.
- `VoxelMesher` owns the common iteration, Shape expansion/transform, visibility evaluation, mesh emission, and reusable occlusion-result cache. In-bounds neighbors come from the common volume read contract; its protected outside-volume hook returns `Voxel::Cell{}` by default.
- `Chunk::Mesher` is the EP-004 world-aware subclass. It overrides only outside-volume neighbor lookup through Chunk world/collection state so a voxel in Chunk B can occlude a boundary polygon in Chunk A.
- `MaterialResolver` independently selects the `paletteElementIndex` for each emitted polygon.
- Base `VoxelMesher` never depends directly on `Chunk::Collection`; `Chunk::Mesher` does not duplicate the generic algorithm or cache.

## Epic ownership

| Epic | Owns | Does not own |
|---|---|---|
| EP-001 | Concrete owning volume contract; dimensions/cell access/uniform scale/bounds; batched editing/versioning; fixed-dimension 16³ Chunk adaptation; semantic runtime-sized VoxelModel type | World lookup, streaming, external occlusion, meshing, rendering |
| EP-032 | Generic VoxelMesher; cached occlusion; default outside-is-empty hook; MaterialResolver contract; Shape expansion; visibility; deterministic VoxelMesh output | Chunk::Collection, streaming, GPU upload |
| EP-004 | Chunk::Mesher outside-neighbor override; world/local lookup; Chunk integration; bake scheduling; dirty/version and neighbor invalidation; streaming/generation integration | A second meshing algorithm or duplicate occlusion cache |

The structural order is EP-001 → EP-032 → EP-004 at the required-contract level. EP-001 plus EP-029 feeds EP-030. EP-001, EP-030, and EP-032 feed EP-002; EP-002 then feeds EP-031.

## Pure VoxelModel and separate VoxelAssembly

A VoxelModel asset is reusable pure volume data: dimensions, voxel scale, occupancy/Shape-or-cell data, and an authored palette element index. It contains no anchors, pivots, parents, skeleton, animation, equipment slots, or world transform.

A VoxelAssembly separately defines named anchors, optional parent anchors, local transforms, and parts that reference reusable VoxelModels. Animation clips target anchor transforms. Hierarchy evaluation produces per-part model matrices. It never edits voxel geometry or invokes `VoxelMesher`; cached part meshes remain valid.

Equipment uses the same named-anchor mechanism and reusable model parts. The exact anchor vocabulary and serialized model/assembly/animation syntax require user-approved sample assets before they are frozen. EP-002 owns runtime representation and execution. EP-031 owns external authoring/import and production fixtures that consume EP-002 contracts.

## Palette and mesh contract

A CPU-side `PaletteCollection` may manage Palette resources, but it is not uploaded as one global GPU buffer. Each `Palette` is independently associated with its own SSBO. A render command binds the program, mesh vertex/index buffers, the Palette required by that renderable, transform data, and then draws.

`VoxelMesh` vertices semantically carry at least `position`, `normal`, and integer `paletteElementIndex`. The index is flat/non-interpolated and addresses the currently bound Palette SSBO. It is not a Voxel ID, and no GPU `paletteId` exists in the initial design.

Palette selection belongs to the renderable/part instance, not the pure model asset. Consequently one cached arm mesh can render with Human, Orc, or Undead palettes without remeshing. All referenced indices must exist in the bound Palette; an out-of-range reference is detected and rejected.

Chunks normally share one relatively large `WorldPalette`. Chunk material resolution may use both the Shape polygon's semantic `materialSlot` and spatial `outerSide`; these concepts remain distinct. A dedicated content-schema ticket defines precedence among default, slot, side, and exact slot+side overrides after a user-approved example. Top, side, bottom, and individual sides can resolve to different elements of the same WorldPalette.

Chunks and VoxelModels use the same VoxelMesh format and voxel shader. Changing the bound Palette changes material output but neither mesh geometry nor mesher invocation count.

## Visual-regression sequence

1. Capture and manually approve current textured Chunk images.
2. Introduce VoxelVolume, the generic cached VoxelMesher/default boundary hook, and the Chunk::Mesher override.
3. Prove semantic mesh parity and unchanged textured images.
4. Introduce palette-based rendering as a separate intentional migration.
5. Review expected, produced, and difference images manually.
6. Only after approval, add a new versioned expected baseline.

Required semantic fixtures cover authored model indices, Chunk slot/side mapping, top/side/bottom and per-side variation, invalid indices, identical geometry across Palette swaps, no remesh on Palette swap, consistent polygon vertex indices, internal-face occlusion, multiple Shapes, and deterministic output. Golden fixtures cover the corresponding visible cases and render one model mesh with two Palettes plus a Chunk through WorldPalette.

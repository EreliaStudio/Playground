# Erelia Implementation Status

**Last updated:** 21 September 2026

**Implementation base:** `main` at `3cfae1c79e9a9dfeb81e4cd96891ff4fb3510cfd`

**Delivery:** [PR #9](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/pull/9) from `feature/st-003-02-palette-binding`

**Current horizon:** H0 — Foundations and visual validation

**Current checkpoint:** ST-003-02 is complete, including owner-approved Palette golden images. OD-028 resolves direct WorldPalette semantic slot binding and fallback; ST-033-01 remains gated only where OD-019 procedural variation is required.

This is the living answer to:

> Where are we now, what has actually been completed, and what should be implemented next?

## Completed

### Current implementation baseline

- ✅ Data-driven voxel Shapes, Definitions, compact packed `Voxel::Cell`, fixed 16³ Chunk behavior, Collection/world lookup, and the unified `VoxelMesher`/`Chunk::Mesher` path exist.
- ✅ The duplicated `Chunk::Baker` implementation is retired; its approved semantic snapshots remain as independent historical parity fixtures.
- ✅ The existing textured Chunk renderer is the protected visual baseline for structural work.
- ✅ Deliberate failures originating in Playground C++ code use `spk::Exception`, including validation, state, catalog lookup, and test-library diagnostics.

### Installed test/package infrastructure

- ✅ Sparkle exports the optional installed `Sparkle::TestLibrary` component.
- ✅ Playground resolves `sparkle CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS TestLibrary` and links `Sparkle::TestLibrary` through `PlaygroundTestLibrary`.
- ✅ CI downloads the checksum-pinned prebuilt Sparkle `0.1.2` package at `65c1091fcc3d3387f7d019486e3538c7df5572d6`; Playground does not rebuild Sparkle source.
- ✅ CPU/headless and Windows/OpenGL jobs are separate and retain diagnostics/artifacts.
- ✅ Architecture planning used the older Sparkle baseline `9784377d41509234d43e4adec16505382eef178f`; it is not presented as the currently consumed package.

### ST-001-01 — Current Chunk characterization

- ✅ Semantic tests cover storage/indexing, coordinates, Collection, Editor, scheduler, meshing, transforms, catalog, Shape, and packed Cell behavior.
- ✅ The Windows/OpenGL harness covers five scene families from four fixed views each.
- ✅ All 20 approved current textured Chunk PNG references are checked in.
- ✅ The controlled UV-regression sensitivity path proves an altered UV fails comparison without changing tolerances or references.
- ✅ OD-024 records the approved fixtures, `640 × 480` capture, and canonical `windows-2025` software-OpenGL runner.
- ✅ Main-branch [CI run 35456326462](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35456326462) passed both `CPU/headless tests` and `Windows/OpenGL golden candidates` for commit `0bd12e5`.

### Planning and decisions

- ✅ The backlog contains 34 epics, 137 tickets, and 28 persistent decision records.
- ✅ Eight decisions are resolved: OD-011, OD-020, OD-023, OD-024, OD-025, OD-026, OD-027, and OD-028. Twenty remain open.
- ✅ OD-011 selects one concrete vector-owning `VoxelVolume` base and explicitly accepts replacing Chunk's fixed array during ST-001-03.
- ✅ OD-023 preserves the existing packed Cell orientation/vertical-flip representation until evidence justifies a separate expansion decision.

### ST-001-02 — VoxelVolume contract and generic editor

- ✅ `VoxelVolume` owns runtime-sized, zero-initialized `std::vector<Voxel::Cell>` storage.
- ✅ Runtime dimensions, finite positive uniform voxel size, checked coordinate access, read-only span access, and origin-based local bounds are implemented.
- ✅ Meshing-facing access is read-only; controlled mutation uses the generic nested `VoxelVolume::Editor`.
- ✅ `VoxelVolume` owns versioning, and a changed editor session publishes exactly one invalidation while a no-op session publishes none.
- ✅ VoxelVolume-owned failures use the selected `spk::Exception` policy with stable messages and source-location diagnostics.
- ✅ Twelve focused headless GoogleTests cover metadata/validation, access/topology, editor/version transactions, and Sparkle exception diagnostics.
- ✅ Branch [CI run 35460049379](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35460049379) passed both complete lanes for remote commit `d00e467`.
- ✅ Editor/version refinement [CI run 35461166765](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35461166765) passed both complete lanes for remote commit `9effce8`.
- ✅ Sparkle-exception refinement [CI run 35463284473](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35463284473) passed both complete lanes for remote commit `7b04ab2`.
- ✅ No approved golden reference, tolerance, texture, UV, Chunk implementation, or rendering output changed.

### ST-001-03 — Chunk adapter/specialization

- ✅ `Chunk` now derives from `VoxelVolume` and constructs the shared storage as exactly `16×16×16` at voxel size `1.0`.
- ✅ Chunk's duplicate fixed array, direct `VersionedTrait` inheritance, and duplicate editor implementation were removed.
- ✅ `Chunk::edit()` resolves to the inherited `VoxelVolume::Editor`; changed and no-op sessions retain the established one-notification transaction behavior.
- ✅ Chunk keeps its coordinate, world conversion, Collection, generation, baking, scheduling, and rendering responsibilities.
- ✅ Focused Chunk tests cover the fixed constructor specialization and Chunk-owned coordinate/index behavior; inherited storage, access, editor, versioning, and diagnostics remain covered once by the VoxelVolume suites.
- ✅ BakeScheduler coverage proves an edited Chunk queues itself and every available face-neighbor for rebuild.
- ✅ Implementation commit: [`27c095f`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/27c095f467cdb4bd1525aa5be81bccfab889b5fb).
- ✅ Test-ownership refinement commit: [`f3f855b`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/f3f855b71c67bfb96100bb09a3e52fbedd14683b).
- ✅ PR #4 [CI run 35467461734](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35467461734) passed both `CPU/headless tests` and `Windows/OpenGL golden candidates` for commit `f3f855b`.
- ✅ No approved reference, comparison tolerance, texture, UV, or intended rendering output changed.

### ST-001-04 — Runtime-sized VoxelModel storage

- ✅ `VoxelModel` is one final semantic specialization over `VoxelVolume`; runtime dimensions and uniform voxel scale remain constructor data rather than template parameters.
- ✅ Representative `10×10×14`, `12×7×14`, and `32×32×22` models use the same C++ type.
- ✅ An `8×8×16` model at scale `0.1` reports local bounds `0.8×0.8×1.6`.
- ✅ `VoxelModel` inherits the common packed-cell read contract, batched editor, version notification, and `spk::Exception` validation policy without adding a model-specific mutation API.
- ✅ A provisional `spk::JSON::Reader` constructor accepts runtime dimensions, voxel size, and sparse `{position, value, orientation, flip}` entries without changing packed Cell storage.
- ✅ Sparse-loader duplicate detection uses `spk::Vector3Int` directly as an ordered key through Sparkle `0.1.2`; the temporary tuple adapter is removed.
- ✅ Orientation and flip use reviewed named strings; `orientation` is required and omitted `flip` defaults to `positive-y`.
- ✅ Duplicate or out-of-range positions, unknown fields/enum names, and values beyond packed Cell capacity fail with JSON file/path diagnostics.
- ✅ Nine focused headless GoogleTests cover runtime storage plus the provisional sparse JSON loader and its rejection behavior.
- ✅ No stable asset format, file-loading API, catalog mapping, rendering, Palette, GPU, transform, anchor, animation, or Chunk-world behavior was added.
- ✅ Implementation head: [`affc850`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/affc850945e233928acfa813e7add7d7a8a6cf69).
- ✅ PR #5 [CI run 35498639959](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35498639959) passed both `CPU/headless tests` and `Windows/OpenGL golden candidates`.

### ST-032-01 — Current Baker semantic golden fixtures

- ✅ Seven minimal fixtures lock the current cube, slab, slope, stair, cross, unloaded-neighbor, and cross-Chunk occlusion semantics.
- ✅ Canonical snapshots compare positions, normals, atlas UVs, winding, and visible topology while ignoring triangle emission order, vertex-buffer indices, and cyclic starting vertices.
- ✅ Exact Chunk/cell coordinates, stable Definition names/runtime IDs, orientations, flips, topology, and atlas expectations are recorded with the fixtures.
- ✅ Boundary coverage proves an absent adjacent Chunk is empty and an available solid neighbor removes only the shared face across local X coordinates `15 → 0`.
- ✅ Repeated inputs produce byte-identical semantic output; an unknown Definition ID throws `spk::Exception` without poisoning subsequent valid bakes.
- ✅ At this checkpoint, `Chunk::Baker` remained intact as the later `VoxelMesher` parity oracle; ST-004-01 subsequently retired its implementation after parity passed.
- ✅ No approved textured reference, comparison tolerance, camera, atlas, shader, or canonical runner changed.
- ✅ OD-025 records the approved one-base-mesher design: shared cached occlusion in VoxelMesher and only external-neighbor lookup overridden by Chunk::Mesher.
- ✅ Semantic-fixture implementation: [`aa1b9c2`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/aa1b9c216a86476ebef0bd46000bf38b9c82e8a8).
- ✅ Playground-wide Sparkle-exception refinement: [`f0db728`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/f0db728d49360e78e9d7e44ff16d2fe83d715ff8).
- ✅ PR #6 [CI run 35502696771](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35502696771) passed both `CPU/headless tests` and `Windows/OpenGL golden candidates` after the exception-policy refinement.

### ST-032-02 — Unified VoxelMesher and Chunk::Mesher implementation

- one base `VoxelMesher` owns deterministic iteration, scale-aware Shape transforms, textured mesh emission, visibility, and the reusable occlusion cache;
- base outside-volume lookup returns `Voxel::Cell{}`, while derived `Chunk::Mesher` overrides only that hook through `Chunk::Collection`;
- an `8 × 8 × 16`, scale-`0.1` JSON cross statue and identical procedural raw volume emit the same `290` vertices/`432` indices and pixel-identical four-view captures;
- filled adjacent Chunk sections prove `144 → 120 + 120` indices, hidden-neighbor occlusion, both-rendered output, and correct lookup in all six directions;
- all seven ST-032-01 snapshots match, rejected IDs use `spk::Exception`, repeated bakes reuse the cache, and the existing Baker remained untouched at this checkpoint as the parity oracle;
- candidate artifact `10606095311` from CI run `35510619947`, SHA-256 `91bb25488ec4a2c0f5c4c47184559ae1f6e9b44922e82e4a1f7abff36ec447d4`, was explicitly approved by the project owner;
- commit [`ae1deac`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/ae1deac7a3d1ac7dbf2e8d75f08780b863845c35) checks in those exact twelve `640 × 480` PNGs while preserving the existing 20 references;
- comparison-lifecycle fix [`6e0054f`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/6e0054f098a241193cec0781090ddf17d67f44c0) protects JSON/procedural parity inputs from successful-comparison cleanup;
- CI run [35513348937](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35513348937) passes both the complete CPU/headless and Windows/OpenGL lanes with all 32 approved references.

ST-032-03 and ST-004-02 are superseded by this approved consolidation.

### ST-004-01 — Transition Chunk consumers from Baker to Chunk::Mesher

- ✅ `Chunk::Mesher` is a directly declared nested Chunk specialization in `chunk_mesher.hpp`; no compatibility alias or prefixed top-level class was introduced.
- ✅ The application owns one `Chunk::Mesher`, and `Chunk::BakeScheduler` uses that instance without a second adapter or meshing loop.
- ✅ Scheduler tests preserve completion delivery, empty/solid mesh index counts, version invalidation, and exactly-once rebuild scheduling for the edited Chunk plus every available face-neighbor.
- ✅ Invalid Definition data throws `spk::Exception`; repairing it requeues and successfully bakes both the source and available neighbor.
- ✅ Seeded generation is unchanged in the approved rendered fixture and now has explicit replay coverage across different request orders.
- ✅ The retained ST-032-01 snapshots independently protect old Baker semantics while all consolidated VoxelMesher numerical/semantic tests remain unchanged.
- ✅ The obsolete Baker declaration, implementation, private occlusion cache, and Baker-only tests were removed; no production or test source references `Chunk::Baker`.
- ✅ All 20 current textured Chunk references and all 12 consolidated-mesher references remain byte-for-byte unchanged.
- ✅ Consumer-transition implementation: [`7fd8029`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/7fd8029b849b5244324ef5c4fafd91e344e13689).
- ✅ Nested-type refinement: [`d0edb2a`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/d0edb2af4aacf4fc9e01b953a8a2143889a89f38).
- ✅ PR #7 [CI run 35514737157](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35514737157) passed both complete CPU/headless and Windows/OpenGL lanes with all 32 approved references.

### ST-032-04 — Deterministic compatible-vertex reuse

- ✅ OD-020 records the project-owner-approved policy: no polygon merging, exact position/normal/UV compatibility, deterministic first-seen indices, and preserved hard flat normals.
- ✅ One bake-local lookup in `VoxelMesher` serves `VoxelVolume`, `VoxelModel`, and inherited `Chunk::Mesher`; no Chunk-specific indexing loop exists.
- ✅ The smallest existing sharing fixture is one `debug_stair`: `40 → 38` vertices while indices remain `60`. The JSON/procedural fixture changes `290 → 288` vertices while retaining `432` indices.
- ✅ A two-cube atlas-seam fixture remains `40` vertices/`60` indices, and a cube corner retains three distinct hard-normal vertices.
- ✅ Focused tests prove exact compatible reuse, normal and UV separation, byte-identical repeated output, identical generic/Chunk output, and clean recovery after an invalid Definition throws `spk::Exception`.
- ✅ Existing scale, orientation, vertical flip, clipped-polygon, six-direction Chunk-neighbor, cross-Chunk occlusion, winding, cache, and all seven ST-032-01 semantic snapshot results remain valid.
- ✅ Implementation commit [`1120e1b`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/1120e1bd462f44ff128b59dad528c84e9988a123) is delivered by [PR #8](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/pull/8).
- ✅ [CI run 35521204431](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35521204431) passes both complete lanes; all 20 original Chunk and 12 consolidated-mesher `640 × 480` references pass unchanged.
- ✅ No timing claim is made because the available hosted runner is not a controlled benchmark environment; no unstable timing assertion was added.

### ST-003-02 — Palette resource binding and unified voxel shader contract

- ✅ `Palette` owns one independently bindable Sparkle SSBO by composition and keeps a typed `ShaderStorageBuffer::View<void, Palette::Data>` over its RGBA entries; reference edits require explicit `validate()`.
- ✅ `VoxelMesh` carries position, hard flat normal, and integer `paletteElementIndex`; the attribute and both shader stages preserve its integer, flat/non-interpolated contract.
- ✅ `MaterialResolver` receives immutable volume, Definition, transformed emitted polygon, coordinate, and Cell context and returns only the currently bound Palette element index.
- ✅ Generic `VoxelMesher` and `Chunk::Mesher` emit the same deterministic Palette mesh representation. Palette element identity participates in compatible-vertex reuse, so material seams cannot collapse while existing polygons and hard normals remain intact.
- ✅ `VoxelRenderCommand` accepts a required Palette reference, retains a shared-resource Palette value copy, and binds program → mesh → Palette → camera/model data → draw. Per OD-027 it trusts prepared mesh/Palette compatibility and does not rescan vertices.
- ✅ Palette/transform swaps reuse identical vertex/index bytes and do not invoke the mesher again. Sequential Human/Orc commands bind different resources; Chunk and VoxelModel use the same mesh/shader path.
- ✅ The existing TextureMesh3D atlas path, all 32 approved textured references, tolerances, and ST-032-04 no-merge policy remain unchanged.
- ✅ OD-026 records the approved RGBA payload, full resolver context, value-copy lifetime, SSBO composition/View, and explicit validation policy.
- ✅ OD-027 records the owner-selected render-command trust boundary: no empty/out-of-range compatibility check in the command, mesher, or shader; compatible inputs are a caller precondition.
- ✅ [Sparkle issue #5](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Sparkle/issues/5) tracks a possible later inheritance migration; ST-003-02 uses the pinned Sparkle `0.1.2` package unchanged.
- ✅ [PR #9 CI run 35538271204](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35538271204) passes both complete lanes for commit [`b5cbcdc`](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/commit/b5cbcdc814a608cf493b0cefe4eb9b2592997bf1).
- ✅ [PR #9 CI run 35572632309](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Playground/actions/runs/35572632309) passes both `CPU/headless tests` and `Windows/OpenGL golden tests` after OD-027 removes render-command validation and the approved Palette references become enforced comparisons.
- ✅ The project owner approved the exact Human, Orc, sequential Human+Orc, and WorldPalette Chunk candidates from final CI run `35538640066` on 21 September 2026. Those four `640 × 480` images are checked in as Palette golden references; the existing textured references remain unchanged.
- ✅ Final-run artifact `10613866642` preserves the rendered actuals and textured-to-Palette difference; artifact `10614355465` preserves the reviewed proposed baselines.

## Current implementation checkpoint

### ⛔ ST-033-01 — Palette Material terrain prototype decision gate

ST-003-02 is complete after owner approval and promotion of its four reviewed Palette references. OD-028 now resolves direct WorldPalette material lookup: one Shape slot maps through the Definition to a human-readable material identifier, then through MaterialResolver to a Palette element; missing visual bindings use the Palette default configured by `setDefault()` and render opaque magenta. Warning output is deferred until Sparkle provides a logger. OD-019 remains a separate gate only for procedural Palette variation; direct element lookup does not require it.

## Next implementation sequence

| Order | Status | Work | Why it comes here |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | ✅ | [ST-001-02](epics/EP-001-unified-voxel-volume/tickets/ST-001-02-read-only-voxelvolume-contract.md) — owning VoxelVolume/read/edit contract | Generic storage, reads, editing/versioning, Sparkle diagnostics, and both complete CI lanes are passing. |
| 2 | ✅ | [ST-001-03](epics/EP-001-unified-voxel-volume/tickets/ST-001-03-chunk-adapter-specialization.md) — Chunk inheritance/storage/editor migration | Chunk now uses inherited 16³/1.0 storage, reads, editing, and versioning while retaining Chunk-only behavior and unchanged rendering. |
| 3 | ✅ | [ST-001-04](epics/EP-001-unified-voxel-volume/tickets/ST-001-04-runtime-sized-voxelmodel-storage.md) — runtime-sized VoxelModel semantic type | One semantic model type now forwards runtime dimensions and scale to shared storage and inherits editing/versioning unchanged. |
| 4 | ✅ | [ST-032-01](epics/EP-032-unified-voxel-mesher/tickets/ST-032-01-current-baker-semantic-golden-fixtures.md) — current Baker semantic fixtures | Seven canonical fixtures now protect positions, normals, atlas UVs, winding, visible topology, and both Chunk-boundary outcomes. |
| 5 | ✅ | [ST-032-02](epics/EP-032-unified-voxel-mesher/tickets/ST-032-02-generic-cell-iteration-and-scale-aware-shape-transform.md) — unified VoxelMesher + Chunk::Mesher | Shared algorithm/cache, Chunk specialization, numerical/semantic evidence, and all twelve approved references pass both CI lanes. |
| 6 | ✅ | [ST-004-01](epics/EP-004-chunk-world-generation/tickets/ST-004-01-chunk-mesher-integration.md) — transition Chunk consumers | Application, scheduler, tests, and golden renderer use the nested `Chunk::Mesher`; obsolete Baker code is removed. |
| 7 | ✅ | [ST-032-04](epics/EP-032-unified-voxel-mesher/tickets/ST-032-04-optimization-and-indexed-output.md) — deterministic compatible-vertex reuse | OD-020 is resolved; exact first-seen position/normal/UV reuse preserves polygons, hard normals, semantics, and all 32 references. |
| 8 | ✅ | Prove unchanged semantic mesh and textured golden-image parity after the consumer transition | Retained semantic fixtures and all 32 unchanged image references pass CI run 35514737157. |
| 9 | ✅ | [ST-003-02](epics/EP-003-runtime-rendering-mesh-cache/tickets/ST-003-02-palette-resource-binding-and-voxel-shader-contract.md) implementation | Per-Palette SSBO composition, common mesh/shader contract, caller-owned compatibility, value-copy lifetime, semantic tests, and both CI lanes pass. |
| 10 | ✅ | ST-003-02 Palette golden images | The owner approved the four final-run candidates; exact checked-in references now guard Human, Orc, sequential dual-Palette, and WorldPalette rendering. |
| 11 | ⛔ DECISION | [ST-033-01](epics/EP-033-material-visual-validation/tickets/ST-033-01-palette-material-terrain-prototype.md) — Palette Material terrain prototype | OD-028 resolves direct slot binding and magenta fallback. OD-019 separately gates procedural variation; non-variation portions may proceed from the resolved lookup contract. |
| 12 | ⬜ | EP-030 → EP-002 → EP-031 asset import, runtime assembly, and authored character workflow | Builds model/assembly content on validated runtime contracts. |
| 13 | ⬜ | [VS-000](milestones/VS-000-UNIFIED-VOXEL-VISUAL-VALIDATION.md) | Validates terrain, model, assembly, equipment, Palette, and performance together. |
| 14 | 🔭 | [VS-001](milestones/VS-001-FIRST-PLAYABLE.md) | Starts the gameplay vertical slice after the visual/runtime foundation. |

## Known user gates

- OD-020 is resolved: do not merge polygons; share only exact position/normal/UV matches in deterministic first-seen order and preserve hard flat normals.
- OD-025 is resolved: VoxelMesher owns the common cached algorithm; Chunk::Mesher overrides only outside-volume neighbor lookup.
- OD-026 is resolved: Palette uses RGBA data, SSBO composition/View, explicit validation, the full immutable resolver context, and shared-resource value-copy command lifetime.
- OD-027 supersedes OD-026's command-input validation only: `VoxelRenderCommand` accepts `const Palette&` and trusts the caller's mesh/Palette compatibility without rescanning vertices.
- The four ST-003-02 Palette candidates from CI run `35538640066` were explicitly approved by the project owner on 21 September 2026 and promoted without modifying the pre-existing textured references.
- OD-028 is resolved: one Shape slot maps through the Definition to a human-readable material identifier and through MaterialResolver to one Palette element; `Palette::setDefault(index)` selects the recoverable fallback, which is opaque magenta for H0. Missing visual bindings do not throw merely to stop the game. Warning diagnostics are deferred until Playground consumes a Sparkle logger.
- OD-019 remains open for any procedural Palette variation; direct element lookup is implemented, but variation must not be invented.
- The proposed broader `Material`/`MaterialCollection` layer is explicitly deferred and is not part of PR #9.
- Sparkle SSBO inheritance is deferred to [Sparkle issue #5](https://github.com/EreliaStudio/Sparkle/issues/5); current Palette composition is intentional.
- Approval of any model, assembly, animation, equipment, import, or material-mapping schema before it is frozen.
- Review of expected, produced, and difference images before accepting the later Palette migration baseline.

Additional ambiguity discovered during implementation becomes an Open Decision. The executing agent must not improvise it.

## How to update this file
